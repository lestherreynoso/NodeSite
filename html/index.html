                                        <h3>What to say about this guy...</h3>
                                        <p>
                                        I always had an interest in most computer related things growing up. I've always been interested in knowing 
                                        how everything worked from why the parts in the computer made noise and how the applications I use so often were made.
                                        Because of that I began studying computer science, learning the concepts of programming howeverIstill had an interest in the 
                                        hardware aspect of computer technology. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        At the timeIcouldn't decide which field I had most interest in and I had to make a decision. I decided on tackling them both. 
                                        Along the way I learnedIhave a huge interest in learning new things. I gained interests in game design, game development, 
                                        web development, hardware interfacing (currently with a Raspberry Pi and Arduino board) and robotics. With each of these 
                                        interests I find myself taking time to learn more about them whenIcan.
                                        </p> 
                                        <p>
                                        Currently I am interesting in finding a position whereIcan apply and learn more about the software development process. 
                                        I've been learning about front-end web development and begun investigating on the back-end using Nodejs, as well as rebuilding 
                                        a raspberry pi controlled robot written mostly in Python. I hope to find a position that would teach me more about software 
                                        development or hardware interfacing.
                                        </p>

                                                            a lot rather quickly and keep getting excited when I find something new and just want to implement it. With this
                                                            site I had to learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JQuery in unison. Before this I was not really experienced with any
                                                            of those languages but I feel I have a good grasps on the basics.

                                                            design project. We called it the RES Bot, Robots for Emergency Situations. The Purpose of RES 1.0 was to take some
                                                            readings of its environment and report it back to the user via a web gui accessible from any browser. This bot 
                                                            would detect distance, temperature, light, and motion.

                                                            is what it had in the last version. Local area mapping is also a goal this time around. Possibly camera imaging 
                                                            but that one is a maybe.

                                                            It's because of thatIhave only been able to load allIcould find from my courses. Also of course this website 
                                                            and anythingIhappen to learn and play with like node.

                                                            I wish to improve that portfolio by including a series of self challenges. These challenges are probably going to be 
                                                            example problems or tasksIfind from the internet or textbooks thatIcan tackle using a specific language. The end goal 
                                                            here is to improve my language proficiency starting with low level basic tasks and working my way up with each language. 
                                                            I plan to start with some of the languages im familiar:

                                                            way to go. I read a beginner book that got me started andIwas able to successfully able to write the server, router, 
                                                            and handler whichIwas really excited about. I got my website to work with the Node serverIwrote and that excited me more.

                                                            I plan to investigate futher into Node and see whatIcan do with it. For nowIhave the basics workingIjust have to
                                                            clean it up and I'll be good to continue forward understanding express.
