               <em>... that would make me sound <span id="fan">FANTASTIC!</span></em><br><br>
                <p>
                I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering with a Math minor. I will 
                be entering my fifth year this August in which i expect to gradute the following May. <br><br>

                I have an interest in game design and after taking a course in web game programming and developing this website i have
                also gained an interest web development as well.<br><br>

                I also work with hardware components building and programming a small rc robot using a rasperry pi as the controller. I 
                code a lot in python to communicate with each of the individual components on the robot. <br><br>

                I learned a lot more than i knew about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery very quickly in making this website which i think is cool.
                </p>

                        I am pretty good with doing what i say im going to do. If i make a commitment to someone to get 
                        something done i will get it done. Something pretty bad has to happen for me to fail in that. I am dedicated to seeing
                        challenges i accept lead to successful outcomes. I always try my best with all my committments.

                        I pay a lot of mind to small details when it is necessary. I've learned through my time as chair of my campus' student association
                        policy committee that the smallest of details can have a huge impact on overall outcome. In my coding experience as well that fact 
                        continues to and definitely will prove true when theres a misplaced semi-colon or bracket in the code or the reassignment of an 
                        important variable.

                        Challenges always appeal to me. If I feel I can tackle on another project, task, or class, I go right ahead. Being ambitious has
                        led me to pursue a second major and a minor all while working 10 to 20 hours a week around classes and volunteering my time to my student 
                        government. From that I've developed great work relationships, gained a lot of valueable leadership experience and knowledge as well
                        as recieve a few certifications and awards, and I will be graduating in May of 2015 with two bachelor degrees and a minor.

                        Being ambitious and accepting new challenges has led me to become very well and organizing myself and managing my time appropiately.
                        This past semester I successfully managed 6 classes, 2 jobs, participating in 3 committees, and chairing a committee on a weekly basis. 
                        I can say that the experience reinforced my organizational and time managing skills.

                        Over the course of my education i have worked with others often, each time a new and enriching experience. I have led two groups 
                        in a couple of computer science courses, Software Engineering and Operating Systems and Networking. In my computer engineering 
                        background, I've worked with many partners and groups for our labs or projects. Participating in committees also adds to my 
                        experience either leading or participating with others. With each experience i learned that i enjoy working with others and seeing 
                        each individual contribution come together in a successful final result. Teams also help me learn new things about the limits of what
                        i can acomplish.
