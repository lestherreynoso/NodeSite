NodeSite
========

Combined my site with more node fun for app creation
Surpringly everything worked without any errors. Other than having to add in there some more file types it all went smoothly.

First Draft is up and running at lestherreynoso.herokuapp.com but still a lot of work to do on the site. Making it responsive is one thing im working on now. Also figure out colors.

Second Draft is up and running.. Things left to do is to make the page responsive, make that left panel go all the way down and make the list group in that column scroll with the page.
